ALGO
First you have take the first string from the array and initialize it in the ans string
secondly you have to run the for thr remaining strings and inside that start a while condition will run untile and unless my j<array[i].size() and k<ans.size()
inside while you have to check that if array[i][j] ==ans[k] temp+=array[i][k] else break; j++ and k++; ans=temp
then at last return the answer by ans.length()==0?'1':ans;
