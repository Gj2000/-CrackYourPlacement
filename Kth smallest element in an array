Step one is to create an priority queue
In step 2 we will be pushing the elemnts till k
after that for the rest of the rest of the rest of the elemnts we will comapre
it with the top if the upcoming elment is smaller than the element present at top then pop the top and push that element in the queue
after traversing all the remaining elements the element which is at the top of the queue will be our Kth smallest or Kth largset number
